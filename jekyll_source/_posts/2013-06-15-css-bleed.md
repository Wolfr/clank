I want to talk a bit about <a href="https://github.com/Wolfr/clank/issues/24">Issue #24</a> which is that the stylesheet of the documentation clashes with the sylesheet of the docs.

The way the <a href="http://getclank.com/demos/">demos</a> work, I want the device frame to be independent of the rest. The device frame (e.g. an iPhone) should load the Clank styles, while still visible within this documentation site.

See, in Clank there are CSS styles (applied to all clank components):

{% highlight scss %}
  p {
    font-size: 14px;
    color: #333;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

But then in the docs there are also styles

{% highlight scss %}
  p {
    font-size: 15px; /* Some other font size */
    color: #555; /* Some other color */
  }
{% endhighlight %}

I want the styles of to be separate; then work with the page DOM as a whole.

The simplest solution is to scope everything manually like this:

{% highlight scss %}
  .cl-docs p {
    font-size: 14px;
    color: #333;
  }
  .cl p {
    font-size: 15px; /* Some other font size */
    color: #555; /* Some other color */
  }
{% endhighlight %}

However, this leads to a lot of unnecessary CSS. The fact that there are docs is irrelevant to people using Clank.

I could solve this using an `<iframe>` but that feels a bit messy. I won't be able to access whatever is inside the iframe.
  
Why do I need access to the contents of the frame? Well, for example, I want to change up the DOM from my host page to show animations between screens. I don't want "full encapsulation". I just want my styles to be encapsulated.
  
I experimented a bit with scoped stylesheets and iframes but these are not real solutions. I wrote everything up on this <a href="https://github.com/Wolfr/css-encapsulation-today">Github repo</a>.

I think I might find a solution using web components. In this Google I/O video, the concept of web components is explained very well. It's worth a watch because this *is* the future of the web.

<iframe width="600" height="400" frameborder="none" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0g0oOOT86NY" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen="> </iframe>

I'm documenting this as I go along because the future of the web depends on use cases.

If anyone has thoughts/suggestions/ideas, leave a comment!
