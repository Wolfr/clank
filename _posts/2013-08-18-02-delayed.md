The planned 0.2 release is delayed due to little public interest in Clank.

Open source lives by community and I can't motivate myself to work on a project without an audience.

Since I'll be working on some iPad related projects it's inevitable that Clank will evolve in the future - as I use it in client work some features will get integrated in the framework.
